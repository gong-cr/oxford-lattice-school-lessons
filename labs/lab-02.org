#+TITLE: Lab 2
#+SUBTITLE: Attacks & Lattice Reduction
#+AUTHOR: Martin R. Albrecht and Léo Ducas
#+DATE: March 23, 2017

In this lab, we will make intensive use of Fplll[fn:1] and Fpylll[fn:2]. Fplll is a C++11 library for operating on lattices using floating point arithmetic. It implements Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation, LLL, BKZ, BKZ 2.0 footfullcite:AC:CheNgu11, Slide reduction footfullcite:STOC:GamNgu08 and Self-Dual BKZ footfullcite:EPRINT:MicWal15.

Fpylll is a Python wrapper and extension of Fplll, making its data structures and algorithms available in Python and Sage (7.4 and greater). It also (re-)implements some algorithms in Python to make their internals easily accessible, a feature we will make use of.

*Note:* Both Fplll and Fpylll are evolving software projects. In particular, the current development versions of either library offer improvements over the latest stable released shipped with Sage. Thus, using Fpylll from within Sage and compiling your own version outside of Sage from GitHub will be different. We recommend, if at all possible, to use the latest development version.[fn:3]

That both libraries are evolving software projects also means that (a) you will encounter bugs and (b) we need your help. For example, you will notice that some functions lack documentation, examples and tests. Contributions welcome![fn:4]

* 1 — Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:tangle: lab-02-fpylll.py
:END:

In this lab, we ask you to experiment with LLL and BKZ (2.0) as implemented in Fpylll. We start with a little tutorial on how to use this library. 

To start, we first import the =fpylll= API into Sage’s main namespace:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
from fpylll import *
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Integer Matrices

To experiment, we generate a \(q\)-ary lattice of dimension 100 and determinant $q^{50}$ where $q$ is a 30-bit prime. Before we sample our basis, we set the random seed to ensure we can reproduce our experiments later.

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
set_random_seed(1337)
A = IntegerMatrix.random(100, "qary", k=50, bits=30)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*Reminder:* Objects and functions in Python/Sage can be interrogated to learn more about them such as what parameters they accept (for functions) or (often) their documentation.[fn:5]

** Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalisation

To run LLL we have two choices. We can either run the high-level =LLL.reduction()= function or we can create the appropriate hierarchy of objects “by hand”. That is, algorithms are represented by objects with which we can interact. As this exercise is about dealing with those internal objects, we are going to pursue this strategy. We, hence, first create a =MatGSO= object, which takes care of computing the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation. 

A =MatGSO= object stores the following information:

- An integral basis =B=,
- the Gram-Schmidt coefficients \(μ_{i,j} = ⟨b_i, b^*_j⟩ / \|b^*_j\|^2\) for \(i>j\),
- the coefficients \(r_{i,i} = ⟨b^*_i, b^*_i⟩\) and
- the coefficients \(r_{i,j} = ⟨b_i, b^*_j⟩ = μ_{i,j} ⋅ r_{j,j}  \) for \(i>j\)

It holds that: $B = R × Q = (μ × D) × (D^{-1} × B^*)$ where $Q$ is orthonormal, $R$ is lower triangular and $B^*$ is the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation.

We choose the floating point type (≈ bits of precision) used to represent the Gram-Schmidt coefficients as native =double=, which is fastest and fine up to dimension 170 or so. If you choose =mpfr= for arbitrary precision, you must call =set_precision(prec)= before constructing your object =M=, i.e. precision is global!

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
M = GSO.Mat(A, float_type="d")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

When we say “internal”, we mean it. Note that =M= is lazy, i.e. the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation is only computed/updated when needed. For example, as of now, none of the coefficients are meaningful:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
M.get_r(0,0)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.0

To get meaningful results, we need to trigger the appropriate computation. To compute the complete GSO, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
M.update_gso()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: True

This is better:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
M.get_r(0,0)
A[0].norm()^2  
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.1005727694586943e+18
: 1.1005727694586944e+18

** LLL

We can now create an LLL object which operates on GSO objects. All operations performed on GSO objects, e.g. =M=, are automatically also applied to the underlying integer matrix, e.g. =A=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
L = LLL.Reduction(M, delta=0.99, eta=0.501, flags=LLL.VERBOSE)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Now that we have an LLL object, we can call it, i.e. run the algorithm. Note that you can specify a range of rows on which to perform LLL.

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
L(0, 0, 10)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Entering LLL
delta = 0.99
eta = 0.501
precision = 53
exact_dot_product = 0
row_expo = 0
early_red = 0
siegel_cond = 0
long_in_babai = 0
Discovering vector 2/10 cputime=0
Discovering vector 3/10 cputime=0
Discovering vector 4/10 cputime=0
Discovering vector 5/10 cputime=0
Discovering vector 6/10 cputime=0
Discovering vector 7/10 cputime=0
Discovering vector 8/10 cputime=0
Discovering vector 9/10 cputime=0
Discovering vector 10/10 cputime=0
End of LLL: success
#+end_example

That’s maybe a bit verbose, let’s continue to the end without all that feedback:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
L = LLL.Reduction(M, delta=0.99, eta=0.501)  
L()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

If our LLL implementation is any good, then \(\|μ_{i,j}\| ≤ η\) should hold for all $i>j$. Let’s check:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
all([abs(M.get_mu(i,j)) <= 0.501 for i in range(M.d) for j in range(i)])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: True

We also want to check in on =A=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
A[0].norm()^2
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 13340327827.0

** BKZ

Calling BKZ works similarly: there is a high-level function =BKZ.reduction()= and a BKZ object =BKZ.Reduction=. However, in addition there are also several implementations[fn:6] of the BKZ algorithm in 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
fpylll.algorithms
#+END_EXAMPLE

These are re-implementations of BKZ-syle algorithms in Python which makes them rather hackable, i.e. we can modify different parts of the algorithms relatively easily. To use those, we first have to import them. We opt for BKZ 2.0:[fn:7]

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
from fpylll.algorithms.bkz2 import BKZReduction as BKZ2
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

BKZ 2.0 takes a lot of parameters, such as:

+ =block_size= :: the block size
+ =strategies= :: we explain this one below
+ =flags= :: verbosity, early abort, etc.
+ =max_loops= :: limit the number of tours
+ =auto_abort= :: heuristic, stop when the average slope of \(\log(\|b_i^*\|)\) does not decrease fast enough
+ =gh_factor= :: heuristic, if set then the enumeration bound will be set to this factor times the Gaussian Heuristic.

It gets old fast passing these around one-by-one. Thus, Fplll and Fpylll introduce an object =BKZ.Param= to collect such parameters:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
flags = BKZ.VERBOSE|BKZ.AUTO_ABORT|BKZ.MAX_LOOPS|BKZ.GH_BND
par = BKZ.Param(60, strategies=BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY, max_loops=4, flags=flags)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

The parameter =strategies= takes a list of “reduction strategies” or a filename for a JSON file containing such strategies. For each block size these strategies determine what pruning coefficients are used and what kind of recursive preprocessing is applied before enumeration. The strategies in =BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY= were computed using fplll’s =strategizer=.[fn:8]

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
strategies = load_strategies_json(BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY)
print strategies[60]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: '/home/malb/.virtualenvs/fpylll2/share/fplll/strategies/default.json'
: Strategy< 60, (40), 0.29-0.50>

That last line means that for block size 60 we are preprocessing with block size 40 and our pruning parameters are such that enumeration succeeds with probability between 29% and 50% depending on the target enumeration radius.

Finally, let’s call BKZ-60 on our example lattice:

#+BEGIN_SRC sage
bkz = BKZ2(A) # or
bkz = BKZ2(GSO.Mat(A)) # or 
bkz = BKZ2(LLL.Reduction(GSO.Mat(A)))
bkz(par)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* 2 — Experimenting with LLL / BKZ

In this exercise, we ask you to verify various predictions made about lattice reduction using the implementations available in Fpylll.

** root-Hermite factors

Recall that lattice reduction returns vectors such that \(\|v\| = δ_0^n ⋅ \Vol(L)^{1/n}\) where $\delta_0$ is the root-Hermite factor which depends on the algorith. For LLL it  is \(δ_0≈1.0219\) and for BKZ-\(k\) it is \[\delta_0 ≈ \left( \frac{k}{2 π e} (π k)^{\frac{1}{k}}  \right)^{\frac{1}{2(k-1)}}.\] Experimentally measure root-Hermite factors for various bases and algorithms.

** GS norms

Running several tours of BKZ (2.0) plot (the logs of) the norms of Gram-Schmidt vectors after each tour. You have several options to accomplish this result:

- Check out the =dump_gso_filename= option for =BKZ.Param=.

- Set up BKZ parameters to run one tour only an measure between BKZ calls.

- Inherit from =fpylll.algorithms.bkz2.BKZReduction= and add the functionality to plot after each tour.

If you are running from within Sage, you can simply call =line()= to plot, e.g. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sage :file line-plot-sage.png
line(zip(range(10),prime_range(30)), color="lightgrey", dpi=300r)
#+END_SRC


#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth
#+RESULTS:
[[file:line-plot-sage.png]]

In vanilla Python, you can use matplotlib[fn:9]

#+BEGIN_SRC sage :results none
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
X = range(10)
Y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
plt.plot(X, Y)
plt.ylabel('primes!!!')
plt.savefig("line-plot-matplotlib.png", dpi=300r, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
[[./line-plot-matplotlib.png]] 

** GSA

Schnorr’s geometric series assumption (GSA) states that the norms of the Gram-Schmidt vectors after lattice reduction satisfy \[bla \] where $n$ is the dimension of the lattice. Check how well this assumption holds for various block sizes of BKZ and BKZ 2.0.

** Costs

- Measure cost

- Compare statistics

* 3 — Dual Attack

 - Given a SIS instance, mount the best attack according to the model

 - (opt) Improve it using cleverer strategies (e.g. autotuned progressive strategy)

* 4 — Primal Attack

* 5 — Pruned Enumeration

Improve the previous by introducing a pruned enumeration on the whole lattice after BKZ reduction
