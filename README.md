# Lessons for Oxford Spring School on Lattice-based Cryptography

## Outline ##

1. Intro to Sage
2. Constructing (Ring-)LWE instance (matrices, polynomials, cyclotomic rings, conversions)

Ali:  
> Martin, you can assume that people know Python or some other programming languages. If you have a handout with the main Sage commands that you will use, we can distribute it to the students at the beginning of the school so that they can practice them before your session. 
>  
> You have two sessions so I would suggest the following;
>  
> First session; intro to (Lattice-related) Sage, then implementation of one (or more) lattice-based constructions. Additionally, you can give them a homework for the next day, say you ask them to try to implement an attack that has been explained by Léo.
>  
> Second session; more on Sage if needed, and solve the homework.
